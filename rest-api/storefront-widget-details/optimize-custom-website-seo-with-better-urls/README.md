# Optimize custom website SEO with better URLs

When you add an Ecwid store to a custom website, it creates dynamic pages for the catalog, allowing customers to browse products without needing to reload the page. The URL updates automatically as they navigate. Ecwid generates different URL formats based on your websiteâ€™s setup and the features you have enabled. Some of these URLs are shorter, making them more user-friendly and better for SEO.

By enabling specific features, you can optimize your product and category page URLs for improved readability and search engine (or SEO) performance.
